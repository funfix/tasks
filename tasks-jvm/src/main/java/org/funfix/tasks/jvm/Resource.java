/**
 * A {@code Resource} represents a resource that can be acquired asynchronously.
 * <p>
 * This is similar to Java's {@link AutoCloseable}, but it's more portable
 * and allows for asynchronous contexts.
 * <p>
 * {@code Resource} is the equivalent of {@link Task} for resource acquisition.
 * <p>
 * Sample usage:

 *     // -------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *     // Creates temporary files â€” note that wrapping this in `Resource` is a
 *     // win as `File` isn't `AutoCloseable`).
